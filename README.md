Codex Lucani is  a rudimentary Latin-English dictionary and translation application built using Web Forms design architecture on ASP.NET.

It includes three features (though only two of them have been made functional) contained in a navigation panel anchored on the left side of the screen.
  1) The first is the Subject-Object-Translator (or SOV) that translates simple Latin sentences containing jus a subject, object, and verb      in the Present Indicative to its English equivalent, and vice-versa.
  2) the second items pops up the Inflector, whose function is to list all o fhte spelling cases for a given Latin word accompanied by an      English translation.
  3) Finally, the third item is a Dictionary features that lists a full list of Latin words and their corresponding definitions in a            GridView object.
